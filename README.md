We are going to analyze data from a speed dating study. These data were gathered from graduate students in speed dating events from 2002-2004 at Columbia University. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. 

Modeling Goal: To predict whether or not a participant decides that they want a second date.
